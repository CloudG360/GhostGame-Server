I'll write something here with instructions in a bit. It's not ready to be ran yet. :)



## AQA List of Features: 

Format: `- [ ] AQA Spec (My Implementation idea)`

### Group A

**Model:**
- [ ] Complex data model in database (Leaderboards?)
- [x] Hash tables, lists, stacks, queues, graphs, trees or structures of equivalent standard (Stacks, Queues)
- [x] Complex user-defined use of object-orientated programming model (Both Client and Server)
- [x] Complex client-server model (The backbone of the project)

**Algorithms:**
- [x] Cross-table parameterised SQL (Authentication)
- [ ] Aggregate SQL functions (User stats, all time score?)
- [ ] User/CASE-generated DDL script (???)
- [x] Graph/Tree Traversal (Use of the project's JSON api?)
- [ ] List operations  `-- TODO: CHECK`
- [ ] Linked list maintenence
- [x] Hashing (Authentication: Password storage with SHA1-like hash)
- [ ] Advanced matrix operations (???)
- [x] Recursive Algorithms (Event System: Runtime @EventHandler recognition)
- [x] Complex user-defined algorithms (Scheduler, and probably a few other things)
- [x] Dynamic generation of objects based on complex user-defined use of OOP model `-- TODO: Maybe elaborate on meaning`
- [x] Server-side scripting using request and response objects and server-side extensions for a complex client-server model (Most of the processing is server side)
- [ ] Calling parameterised Web service APIs and parsing JSON/XML to service a complex client-server model (Gravatar profile pictures?)


### Group B

**Model:**
- [x] Simple data model in database (Authentication/User data)
- [ ] Multi-dimensional arrays (Map tile/path data)
- [x] Dictionaries (Heavy use of java's HashMap)
- [ ] Records `--TODOL CHECK "StoredIdentity"`
- [x] Text files (Json Parser for configuration)
- [x] Simple client-server model (Coursework backbone smh)

**Algorithms:**
- [x] Single table or non-parameterised SQL
- [ ] Bubble Sort `--TODO: Check where an insertion sort would go cause scheduler + check for this`
- [ ] Binary search
- [x] Writing and reading from files (Configuration)
- [x] Simple user defined algorithms
- [x] Generation of objects based on simple OOP model
- [x] Server-side scripting using request and response objects and server-side extensions for a simple client-server model
- [ ] Calling Web service APIs and parsing JSON/XML to service a simple client-server model


### Group C

**Model:**
- [x] Single-dimensional arrays
- [x] Appropriate choice of simple data types
- [x] Single table database

**Algorithms:**
- [x] Linear search
- [x] Simple mathematical calculations
- [ ] Non-SQL table access `-- Unless I have? idk`
